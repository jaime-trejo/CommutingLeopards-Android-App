# Commuting Leopards Android Application
Android application prototype for Wentworth Institute of Technology's Sustainability Department.

Purpose: We want to be able to provide an <b>eco awareness</b> application, using Google's Maps API, that allows Wentworth's commuters to determine their method of transportation they would want to take to school. By giving them this ability we are able to display the amount of <b>emission</b> for that trip. 

We also provided:
* Commuting Tips
* Emission Data



####This Android application was created by Jaime Trejo, Joseph Gay, Mark Ambrefe, Jimmy Nguyen and Micheal Kemp.

All documents for this application can be found here:  [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B485TfLMdYCoaFhYSGZiRUxJSVU).

## Menu Screen

When the user is in the menu screen they can either retrieve their current location or fill it in with the help of the Places Auto Complete Adapater that Google provides. Once, they have done that then they can click on go and be taken to the map.

They are also able to open up a navigation bar that is located in upper-left corner. 

## Map Screen

When the user is in the map screen he/she will be able to select a method of transportation: car, train, bicycle, walking or a hybrid form. In the bottom of the screen they will be given a snapshot of how far the starting location is from the school and what the emission output would be.

## Navigation Drawer 

The navigation drawer provides the user with the following pages:
* Tips: Vehicle Safety, Personal Safety, Bus Safety, Train Safety, Bicycle - Traffice Principles and Bicycle - Gear Basics
* Emission Info: Student Emission Pie Chart, General Green Tips, Walking, Biking and Driving
* About: Information on the creators of the application and who they wish to thank.
* License: Licensing information that Google's API mentioned that we should provide.
